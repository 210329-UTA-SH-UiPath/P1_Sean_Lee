# Project Pizza Box!

## Project Description
This web application can be easily utilized by store managers and customers. 

Customers can create an account and login; select a store of their choice; and customize their pizzas by choosing from various crusts, styles, and toppings. The price of the order/pizza is calcuated and the customer can decide whether or not to proceed. Once the order is placed, it is stored for later use. If logged in, a customer can view previous orders that he/she have made.

Store managers can access a list of registered customers and orders. Orders and customers can be isolated by their respective Order and Customer IDs.
